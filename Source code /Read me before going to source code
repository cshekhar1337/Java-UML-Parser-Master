Open Intellij Idea 
go to file-> open then select parser folder
In the project explorer window select the parser project right click go to module settings.
In that select project sdk java 1.7
Also click on the dependency tab to select the dependency. Click on + . It will open the window which shows the files inside the  parser project.
Now select antlr-4.5.1-complete.jar and plantuml.jar
After adding these dependency. Go to run -> edit configuration
Now enter the program arguments. two arguments are there. one is path to the directory. Other is output file name along with its path. 
for example: 
/home/shekhar/Desktop/uml-parser-test-1/  /home/shekhar/Desktop/test1
Here “/home/shekhar/Desktop/uml-parser-test-1/”  is path to the directory containing the java files
“/home/shekhar/Desktop/test1” is path to output file. Also file name is test1. No need to generate to give extension of the file as the program generates a png file each time.
